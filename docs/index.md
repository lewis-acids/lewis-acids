# Lewis Acids

> A warm wave music band

## our core lineup
* Natalia Asoka Wanigasooriya
* Fedor Ivashchenko

## our style and genre
the warm wave style relies on mostly warm synth sounds and combines the following ones:
* new wave
* synthpop
* indie pop
* post-punk
* pop rock

## our music
[https://lewisacids.bandcamp.com]

## our album info and song lyrics
* [Queen of Diamonds](https://lewisacids.github.io/queen-of-diamonds)

## why do we need a GitHub repo?
here be our lyrics and hopefully someday chords

there is an idea to a add wiki-like explanations to them. to make a hadbook for our songs and albums

GitHub gives us a convenient tool to do this and allows our listeners easily help us any time they like
